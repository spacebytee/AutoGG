# AutoGG
Hypixel AutoGG for modern versions.

This is an AutoGG mod for Minecraft, modeled after [Sk1ers AutoGG mod for 1.8.9](https://sk1er.club/mods/autogg), designed to easily support new servers if needed. Currently, Hypixel is the only supported server. It uses the same regex patterns as Sk1ers, and therefore should function nearly identically.
